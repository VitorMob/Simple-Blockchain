### Description

A simple blockchain code where I make a chain of blocks connected to each other, if a data changes a hash(signature) will change, in other words, every block linked to it will change, thus forming the blockchain feel free to edit the code or else make commit I will be accepting all commits that will add something to the blockchain... I plan in the future to make a simple p2p network.
